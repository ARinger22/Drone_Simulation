## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

## Tools Used
  <ul>
    <li>ReactJs</li>
    <li>Tailwind Css</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
  </ul>
  
## GitHub Repository Structure
  <ul>
    <li>index.js : From where project start executing</li>
    <li>Components : Folder where the main file of front end is present</li>
    <li>Mapapit : To get the map on the website we needed an api</li>
    <li>Picture : some pictured used in website</li>
  </ul>

## Working 
  ### 1. Data Collection and Training : 
  <ul>
    <li>Upload File : First we need to upload file like json file which contains lattitude as lat and longitudes as lng as input</li>
    <li>Simulation : On pressing the simulation , path stars forming on the lat and lng given in file using pause we can stop the simulation and on clicking resume we can resume the simulatio</li>
    <li>Seek Bar : We can use seek bar also to react on any altitude on if the simulation is on and we can pause at that coordinate </li>
  </ul>

## Conclusion
  Using this website we can see the path of the drone using its lattitudes and longitudes and can pause and continue the simulation any number of time as well as we can reach any step of the points came into the path.
